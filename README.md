# Mushroom Classification using Supervised Machine Learning

This repository contains a project aimed at classifying mushrooms as edible or poisonous using various supervised machine learning models. The project utilizes a dataset sourced from Kaggle, consisting of descriptions of hypothetical mushroom samples. The goal is to build and compare different machine learning algorithms to accurately predict the edibility of mushrooms based on their features.

## Project Overview

- **Objective:** Develop models to classify mushrooms as edible or poisonous.
- **Dataset:** Descriptions of hypothetical samples from 23 mushroom species.
- **Source:** Kaggle dataset
- **Reference:** The Audubon Society Field Guide to North American Mushrooms (1981).
- **Target Variable:** 'class' - Edible or Poisonous

## Models Used

- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- K Nearest Neighbor (KNN)
- Bagging Model
- Random Forest
- Naive Bayes
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)

## Key Points

- The project focuses on binary classification of mushrooms.
- Features describe various characteristics of mushrooms.
- Models are trained to predict whether mushrooms are edible or poisonous.

## Project Structure

- `data/`: Contains the dataset and related files.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, preprocessing, and model training.
- `models/`: Trained model files and related code.
- `results/`: Evaluation metrics, model performance visualizations.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the application of supervised machine learning algorithms for mushroom classification. By utilizing different models, we aim to achieve accurate predictions of mushroom edibility based on their features.

## Future Directions

- Enhance model performance through feature engineering.
- Optimize model parameters through hyperparameter tuning.
- Explore ensemble techniques for improved accuracy.
